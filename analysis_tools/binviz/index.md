binviz

Description
-----------
Note that binviz is a research prototype

binviz was written in Visual C# (VS2005 or maybe VS2008). The .zip is the project (source) file so it should load into visual studio and run. There is also a compiled .exe in... /binviz_0.44bw/binviz_0.01/bin/Debug/. You should just be able to double click it and run on a Windows machine. I developed it under XP, but have since used it under Windows 7 and it worked more or less the same. (mouseover event behavior is a little different, but still usable).
