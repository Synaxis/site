# Cyber Techniques

### A collaborative exploration

<br/>

## Welcome to the Cyber Techniques website www.cybertechniques.net

Our site and content has been designed to be easily modified and updated
  * See the [contribute section](#contribute) below for more information

I have started this site as a result of work in my masters degree program in Cyber Security.
With only knowing a small part of the overall big picture I hope to get others to contribute information to this group.


This site was created to contain a compilation of various material related to different cyber techniques that either have existed in the past, that currently exist, or that could exist in the future.


I created this site to contain information which can help people explore various cyber techniques, something that I have found difficult to do while going through my Cyber Security education because there is currently no good compilation of material on this topic.


By compiling a vast amount of information in one place one would ask if this collection of information could be used for more bad than good. The answer is simple, yes. It is no different than anything else. Information on cyber techniques isn't easy to find. Partly due to the fact that that this is a new and evolving area. I think it is also due to people trying to hide this information thinking that making this type of information difficult to find will make things better. I think this makes a good introduction into [obfuscation](techniques/obfuscation/). I believe that information related to cyber techniques should be well known to everyone. Just because it is hard to find information on a particular topic doesn't mean that information cant be obtained, it just takes longer to find what you are looking for. That means it is harder for everyone to find and learn about this evolving topic. Making this information readily available I hope to start to break down the walls between the hidden techniques commonly used by crackers and expose them to researchers, hackers, and others wanting to learn how to overcome threats now and in the future. I want this to be a place where information can be shared, contributed to, disected, and built upon.

The main reason why I am integrating this site and github together is so that it will be easy for anyone to help contribute, share, and use information related to various cyber techniques. Hopefully this will help in some way to keep us ahead of the many cyber threats that exist today and the many that will continually be exposed over the upcoming years.


My goal is not to reduplicate information that is already readily available but to take existing information and archive it for historical and learning purposes in the future.
By not reduplicating efforts that have already been done we can focus our efforts on learning and implementing protections for current or future problems.


## Definitions

### What is cyber?
The definition of cyber is: of, relating to, or characteristic of the culture of computers, information technology, and virtual reality.
Cyber can relate to anything electronic, digital, wired, virtual, internet, or network related.


### What are cyber techniques?
I am using cyber techniques to describe what techniques are used in the cyber realm
You can take a look at the [techniques page](techniques/) for more information

Cyber techniques can be used for both bad and good

Before looking at some of the software related cyber techniques it may be a good idea to review or go over some of the [Assembly Language](assembly/) tutorials provided here. You can also take a look at the [assembly language quick links](#assembly-language-quick-links)

A big focus area today is: Cyber Threats
Different cyber techniques are implemented which help to create:
  * [Malware](malware/)
  * [Social Attacks](#) \(No content available yet\)
  * [Computer Attacks](#) \(No content available yet\)
  * [Cloud Attacks](#) \(No content available yet\)
  * [Infrastructure Attacks](#) \(No content available yet\)

## Assembly Language Quick Links
  * The use of assembly language is common in the various cyber threats. See the links below for more information.
  * [Main Page](assembly/)
  * [Windows x86](assembly/windows/x86/)
  * [Windows x64](assembly/windows/x64/)
  * [Linux x32](assembly/linux/x86/)
  * [Linux x64](assembly/linux/x64/)

## Analysis Tools

## Archiver Tool
The archiver tools is not yet available but is a web based tool that will allow a user to archive a sites page & associated content at a given url

## Contribute
  * Our site is hosted on Amazon.
    * The site repository is located at: [Github](http://site.cybertechniques.net)
  * Our code is hosted on github
    * The techniques code repository is located at: [Github](http://code.cybertechniques.net)
    * The threats code repository is located at: [Github](http://threats.cybertechniques.net)

### Repository Layout
In order to keep the repository checkout process simple and small in size all examples will be contained in separate sub repositories listed under the Cyber Threats group
  * You should use the following form which is prefixed with example and separated by a hyphen(-) where you have a new folder:
    upx obfuscation example:
    example-techniques-obfuscation-packing-upx

## Policies
In order to prevent abuse using content from this site I have a running list below of unacceptable items that will not be permitted in any of the repositories and are listed in alphabetical order (linked content using the [Archiver Tool](#archiver-tool) is acceptable though):
  * binaries (except for free / opensource analysis tools)
    * must be validatable by a known good chacksum
    * once available, the binary must include a snapshot of the known good checksum using the archiver tool for historical purposes
  * stolen information (includes)
    * proprietary information
    * information not for public release
