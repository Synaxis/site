Timeline: Key events in cyber history
Explore some of the technological advances that led to cyberspace and examples of notable hacks.

1988
The Morris worm - one of the first recognised worms to affect the world's nascent cyber infrastructure - spread around computers largely in the US. The worm used weaknesses in the UNIX system Noun 1 and replicated itself regularly. It slowed down computers to the point of being unusable. The worm was the work of Robert Tapan Morris, who said he was just trying to gauge how big the Internet was. He subsequently became the first person to be convicted under the the US' computer fraud and abuse act. He now works as a professor at MIT.

DECEMBER 2006
NASA was forced to block emails with attachments before shuttle launches out of fear they would be hacked.

Business Week reported that the plans for the latest US space launch vehicles were obtained by unknown foreign intruders.

APRIL 2007
Estonian government networks were harassed by a denial of service attack by unknown foreign intruders, following the country's spat with Russia over the removal of a war memorial. Some government online services were temporarily disrupted and online banking was halted.

The attacks were more like cyber riots than crippling attacks, and the Estonians responded well, relaunching some services within hours or - at most - days.

JUNE 2007
The US Secretary of Defense’s unclassified email account was hacked by unknown foreign intruders as part of a larger series of attacks to access and exploit the Pentagon's networks.

OCTOBER 2007
China’s Ministry of State Security said that foreign hackers, which it claimed 42% came from Taiwan and 25% from the US, had been stealing information from Chinese key areas.

In 2006, when the China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) intranet network was surveyed, spywares were found in the computers of classified departments and corporate leaders.

SUMMER 2008
The databases of both Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns were hacked and downloaded by unknown foreign intruders.

AUGUST 2008
Computer networks in Georgia were hacked by unknown foreign intruders around the time that the country was in conflict with Russia. Graffiti appeared on Georgian government websites.

There was little or no disruption of services but the hacks did put political pressure on the Georgian government and appeared to be coordinated with Russian military actions.

JANUARY 2009
Hackers attacked Israel’s internet infrastructure during the January 2009 military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The attack, which focused on government websites, was executed by at least 5,000,000 computers.

Israeli officials believed the attack was carried out by a criminal organisation based in a former Soviet state, and paid for by Hamas or Hezbollah.

JANUARY 2010
A group named the "Iranian Cyber Army” disrupted the service of the popular Chinese search engine Baidu. Users were redirected to a page showing an Iranian political message.

The same “Iranian Cyber Army” had hacked into Twitter the previous December, with a similar message.

OCTOBER 2010
Stuxnet, a complex piece of malware designed to interfere with Siemens industrial control systems, was discovered in Iran, Indonesia, and elsewhere, leading to speculation that it was a government cyber weapon aimed at the Iranian nuclear programme.

JANUARY 2011
The Canadian government reported a major cyber attack against its agencies, including Defence Research and Development Canada, a research agency for Canada's Department of National Defence.

The attack forced the Finance Department and Treasury Board, Canada’s main economic agencies, to disconnect from the Internet.

JULY 2011
In a speech unveiling the Department of Defense’s cyber strategy, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense mentioned that a defense contractor was hacked and 24,000 files from the Department of Defense were stolen.

OCTOBER 2012
The Russian firm Kaspersky discovered a worldwide cyber-attack dubbed “Red October,” that had been operating since at least 2007.

Hackers gathered information through vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Word and Excel programmes. The primary targets of the attack appear to be countries in Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Central Asia, although Western Europe and North America reported victims as well.

The virus collected information from government embassies, research firms, military installations, energy providers, nuclear and other critical infrastructures.

MARCH 2013
South Korean financial institutions as well as the Korean broadcaster YTN had their networks infected in an incident said to resemble past cyber efforts by North Korea.

JUNE 2013
In their first-ever meeting dedicated to cyber defence on Tuesday (June 4), NATO Defence Ministers agreed that the Alliance’s cyber-defence capability should be fully operational by the autumn, extending protection to all the networks owned and operated by the Alliance.

OCTOBER 2013
NCIRC Upgrade - The NATO Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC) upgrade project, a 58 Million euro enhancement of NATO cyber defences, is on track for completion by the end of October 2013. This major capability milestone will help NATO to better protect its networks from the increasing number of cyber attacks against the Alliance's information systems.


1943-1944

History
The digital era jumped ahead with the creation of Colossus, the first programmable digital machine. Though limited compared to later computers, Colossus played a pivotal role in code breaking during World War II. In effect, the British developed the first digital machine to hack German codes.

1961-1962

History
Key steps in the history of global computer networks came when Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in July 1961, and the next year when J.C.R. Licklider, also at MIT, wrote a series of memos spelling out his ideas for a "Galactic Network" in which people could access data from anywhere.

1967-1969

History
The Advanced Research Projects Agency, later known as DARPA, accelerated work on what was initially dubbed ARPANET and eventually came to be known as the Internet. The first ARPANET message was sent at 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 29, 1969.

1971

History
Intel released the first integrated microprocessor, a major leap forward in the history of the computer. It had 2,300 transistors and processed 60,000 instructions per second.
1982

Hack
National security officials in the United States launched one of the world's first cyberattacks on another country: the Soviet Union. U.S. officials heard, through a KGB source named Farewell, that the Soviets intended to buy computer equipment through a front company to operate a gas pipeline. U.S. agents altered the software, which later caused the pipeline to explode.

1986-1987

Hack
In 1986 and 1987, a physics researcher at the University of California at Berkeley uncovered a global hack of academic, military and government computers in the United States. Chronicled later in the book “The Cuckoo's Egg,” it was the first investigation of its kind, and it revealed online hacker threats spread around the globe.

1988

Hack
The first "worm" attack occurred on the Internet. A Cornell University student named Robert Tappan Morris released several dozen lines of code, which replicated wildly and hit thousands of computers hard. It stopped about 10 percent of the 88,000 computers linked to the Internet at the time.

1990

History
ARPANET became an operation network known as the Internet. About 2.6 million people around the globe had access.
1994

Hack
Anonymous hackers repeatedly attacked the Air Force's Rome Laboratory in New York, underscoring the threat to military systems. Investigators discovered that a British teenager and an Israeli technician had used phone systems and networks in eight countries to cloak their attacks on numerous military and government computer systems.

1997

Hack
The Pentagon's first "information warfare" exercise, known as Eligible Receiver, found that industrial and information systems throughout the United States are vulnerable to cyberattacks from hackers using readily available technology and software. Specialists said it appeared as though simulated attacks on power and communications networks in Oahu, Hawaii; Los Angeles; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Washington, D.C.; and elsewhere succeeded with ease.

2003

History
The amount of digital information created by computers, cameras and other data systems this year surpassed the amount of all information created in human history, according to studies by International Data Corp. and EMC.
November 2003

Hack
Hackers apparently supported by China attacked military and government systems in the United States with impunity, making off with terabytes of data. The attacks were dubbed Titan Rain by officials in the United States.

May 2007

Hack
During a dispute between Estonia and Russia, hackers launched massive attacks on Estonian government agencies, banks, newspapers and other organization, using networks of computers to shut down Estonian systems online. Some analysts, blaming Russia, asserted the attacks represent one of the first instances of cyberwar.

2008

History
Cyberspace accelerated its expansion, with the number of devices connected to the Internet exceeding the number of people on Earth for the first time. That number hit an estimated 12.5 billion in 2010, according to a researcher at Cisco who predicted it will rise to 50 billion in 2020. Hundreds of millions of new Internet users also sign on, many millions of them via mobile phones and other portable devices.
November 2008

Hack
The most significant breach of U.S. computer security occurred, apparently when someone working with the Pentagon's Central Command inserted an infected flash drive into a military laptop computer at a base in the Middle East. The case was code named Buckshot Yankee. "The flash drive’s malicious computer code, placed there by a foreign intelligence agency, uploaded itself onto a network run by the U.S. Central Command. That code spread undetected on both classified and unclassified systems, establishing what amounted to a digital beachhead, from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control," a senior U.S. official later wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine.

March 2009

Hack
Canadian researchers identified a Chinese espionage network operating on government computer systems in 103 countries, making it the largest operation of its kind ever publicly identified. The researchers dubbed the system GhostNet.

December 2009

Hack
Communications links with U.S. drones were hacked by Iraqi insurgents, who used laptop computers and inexpensive software. The hack apparently enabled the insurgents to see video images the drone was recording.
January 2010

Hack
Google announced that it and dozens of other companies were the focus of a "highly sophisticated and targeted attack" originating from China. The attack resulted in a huge amount of data being stolen. It was later dubbed Operation Aurora.
February 2010

History
The number of Internet users topped 2 billion. The Defense Department said that although "it is a man-made domain, cyberspace is now as relevant a domain for DoD activities as the naturally occurring domains of land, sea, air and space.”
July 2010

Hack
Researchers discovered the most sophisticated cyberweapon ever to be made public. A "worm" known as Stuxnet, it was designed to seek out certain industrial control systems made by Siemens. Stuxnet took advantage of four zero-day vulnerabilities and appeared to be targeted at a uranium enrichment program in Iran. Specialists said it appeared to have a devastating effect, destroying or damaging hundreds of centrifuges. The New York Times reported that President Obama approved the operation as part of a secret U.S.-Israeli cyberwar campaign against Iran begun under the Bush administration.
November 2010

History
A group of the nation's top scientists concluded in a report to the Pentagon that "the cyber-universe is complex well beyond anyone’s understanding and exhibits behavior that no one predicted, and sometimes can’t even be explained well." The scientists, part of a Pentagon advisory group called JASON, said, "Our current security approaches have had limited success and have become an arms race with our adversaries. In order to achieve security breakthroughs we need a more fundamental understanding of the science of cyber-security."
May 2011

Hack
Sony told Congress that hackers had penetrated the PlayStation network, stealing or misusing the personal information of at least 77 million users. Sony estimated that fallout from the hack cost at least $170 million. It appeared as though criminals masqueraded as members of the anarchist-activist group known as Anonymous.
March 2012

Hack
Gen. Keith Alexander, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, blamed China for taking "astounding" amounts of intellectual propery and for the hack last year of security giant RSA. In testimony before a congressional panel, Alexander hinted at military reprisals. "We reserve the right to use all necessary means — diplomatic, informational, military, and economic — as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law," Alexander testified.
