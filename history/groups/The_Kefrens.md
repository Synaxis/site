## The Kefrens

### Origin
Germany

### Description
Group that started February 1999. Limited signs of activity can be found at their site.
Group comment: "The KEFREN , also spelled 'Chephren' or 'Kephren', has been an old, egypt king, that ruled in the 4th dynastie and the Second Pyramid was built for him, and the sphinx has his face. We took this name, because it sounds good and looks nice on pics :) We want to write good and individual code, like every writer should try to produce. In addition to this, we try to spread knowledge and to give new writers a helping hand in virus creating. All in all we follow the ethics and morals that The Mentor has summed up in his 'Hackers Manifesto'."
